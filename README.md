## 🎞 Phase 4: Film Composition & Sync Practice

### 🎯 What to Learn
- Scoring to picture: spotting cues, matching emotion
- Leitmotifs (recurring musical themes for characters)
- Tempo mapping and time signature shifting
- Creating atmosphere: drones, pads, motifs
- Mixing for film: ducking dialogue, cinematic dynamics

### 🧰 Tools
| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| **Ableton Live / Logic** | Score music while watching film timeline |

- Layer ambient background music with emotional shift (e.g., sunrise → storm)

---

## 🧰 Phase 5: Creative Confidence & Workflow

### 🧠 Build Habits
- Analyze film scores (Hans Zimmer, Thomas Newman, Ramin Djawadi)
- Keep a sketchbook (DAW or manuscript)
- Reverse engineer music you like (what’s the chord structure?)
- Weekly challenges: “1-minute cue” or “compose in 3 chords”

### 🎵 Tools for Idea Capture
| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| **Notion + Trello** | Track theory lessons + project pipeline |
| **Voice Memo App** | Hum melody ideas on the go |
| **Splice** | Royalty-free loops if stuck creatively |
| **Soundtrap** | DAW in browser for sketching |

---

## ✅ Final Milestones
- 🎼 Pass ABRSM Grade 5 and 8 theory exams (or equivalent self-study)
